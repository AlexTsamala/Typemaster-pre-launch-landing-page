### What I learned

It was great project for me because i did every single task without any help from mentors ,so i learned most important think to be independent and i am very happy and looking forward for new challenges.

```html
<div class="social-media">
          <i href="#" class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i>
          <i href="#" class="fa fa-instagram "></i>
          <i href="#" class="fa fa-twitter "></i>
        </div>
```

```css
.location-button:hover .loc-button {
background-color: #D5966C;
}
```

 I am making good progress in Html and Css and after couple of day starting to add JS to my websites.
### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43224166/flexbox-layout-with-multiple-rows-having-3-items-in-each/) - This helped me to learn syntax. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand basics of viewport.
